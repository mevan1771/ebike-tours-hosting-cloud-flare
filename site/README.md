# Ceylon E‑Bike Tours (Scaffold)

This is a lightweight, multi‑page static site scaffold for an e‑bike tour company in Sri Lanka.

- Tech: Tailwind (CDN), vanilla JS
- Theme colors: Gunmetal `#0A2E36`, Bright green `#63F800`, Emerald `#14CC60`
- Pages: `index.html`, `tours.html`, `about.html`, `gallery.html`, `faq.html`, `contact.html`, `book.html`

How to use
- Open `index.html` in a browser (or use a simple server).
- Replace gray blocks with your images.
- Update contact numbers, email, and copy.

Notes
- JS lives in `assets/js/main.js` and handles smooth scrolling, mobile menu, simple animations, and minor UI behaviors.
- For production, consider setting up Tailwind build and optimizing images.
